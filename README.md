# YAGPDB Gacha Minigame
This is a minigame written entirely in the go based templating language used for YAGPDB's Custom Command system

To set it up you will need to add the [Gacha Admin Commands](gacha-admin-cmds.md) and [Gacha User Commands](gacha-user-cmds.md)
For development, adding new characters, etc. I also recommend to add the [Debug Commands](gacha-debug-cmds.md) as well

If you want to see this minigame in action you can check it out on [this Discord Server](https://discord.gg/HXDENcPxce) in the `btr-gacha` channel
